# SmartProvider: Helping Nurses with Home Care

SmartProvider is a CRM designed to help home care nurses better serve their patients. SP manages patient information and displays it in a useful way so nurses can spot trends over time. It restricts access to patient information to only those explicitly authorized to view that information in order to maintain patient privacy. Nurses can record notes and vital information on patients, and nurse administrators can assign follow-up tasks to individual nurses. It also requires documentation for every follow-up so more information about past actions are recorded.

We used Test Driven Development to ensure stability and scalability of our application (52 tests and 108 assertions)
